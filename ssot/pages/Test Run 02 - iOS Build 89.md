# Test Run 02 - iOS Build 89

## Purpose

Execution record for the release candidate test pass. Originally section "iOS
Execution - Build 89" of [[Current State - Release Candidate Test Charter]], which
owns the checks, the device matrix, and the pass criteria this run was measured
against.

The original charter section for this execution carried no run number. "Run 02" is assigned by this page for ordering only; no source names it that.

## Summary

- Date: 3 Aug 2026
- Platform: iOS
- Build: TestFlight 1.0.1 (89)
- Device: iPhone 12 mini, iOS 26.5.2

Failed and aborted: registration blocker #1219 reproduced twice

Defects filed: [#1217](https://github.com/muhammedgaygisiz/travellers-apps/issues/1217), [#1218](https://github.com/muhammedgaygisiz/travellers-apps/issues/1218), [#1219](https://github.com/muhammedgaygisiz/travellers-apps/issues/1219)

## Session 1 - Build Identity And Cold Start

- TestFlight reported build 89 on the physical device named `Mo's iPhone` (iPhone 12 mini, iOS 26.5.2).
- After a force quit, the app restored the existing session and opened the Home feed.
- No startup error, unusual loading state, or raw translation key was observed.
- Result: pass.
- Remaining build-89 checks are still in progress; this row is not yet a completed release-candidate result.

## Session 2 - Language Change In Settings

- Changing the saved language from German to English updated the UI and the Home feed to English.
- Changing it back to German updated the UI correctly.
- The language is intentionally activated when the Settings change is saved; no premature change was expected.
- No raw translation key or text code appeared during either transition.
- Result: pass for the normal Settings flow. The original onboarding transition from issue #1186 still requires a fresh-account run.

## Session 3 - Currency Selection In Settings

- The copy explaining how to add and remove favorite currencies was understandable.
- Tapping the whole GBP row toggled the favorite state; targeting an unexplained icon was no longer necessary.
- The selected state was visually unambiguous.
- The preferred/default currency was selectable without an ambiguous symbol.
- The saved selection persisted after reopening, and the tester restored EUR after the check.
- Result: pass for issue #1187 in the normal Settings flow. The shared onboarding currency controls remain part of the fresh-account run.

## Session 4 - Profile Visibility

- The current public/private state was visible on the normal signed-in profile page without opening edit mode.
- Activating the status opened the matching profile-visibility setting.
- Saving the private state updated the normal profile page to Private.
- Restoring the public state updated the normal profile page to Public.
- The restored public state persisted after reopening the profile.
- Result: pass for issue #1188.

## Session 5 - Current-Device Push Settings

- The current-device explanation was understandable and the control was enabled.
- Disabling push persisted after leaving and reopening the page.
- Re-enabling push also persisted, and iOS notification permission remained allowed.
- Result: pass for the functional device-control portion of issue #1184. Ranking-change delivery and the OS-denied recovery path remain unverified.
- New UX finding: a disabled Save button remains at the bottom even though changes apply immediately and the page can simply be left. This misleading action is tracked by [issue #1217](https://github.com/muhammedgaygisiz/travellers-apps/issues/1217).

## Session 6 - iOS Location-Denial Recovery

- With iOS location access set to Never, the app displayed a readable denied-permission explanation.
- The action labelled `Standort aktivieren` opened the correct BiteTribe page in iOS Settings.
- The label did not make the external navigation clear; the tester expected an in-app activation rather than a Settings handoff.
- On direct return after granting While Using the App, a manual refresh was needed before the restored location was detected.
- After detection succeeded, the previous location error remained visible, leaving a contradictory stale-error state.
- Location was also detected after a later force quit and restart.
- No raw translation key or technical error appeared.
- Result: partial pass with a confirmed remaining defect for issue #1183. Direct-return refresh, stale-error clearing, and clearer action copy remain open.

## Session 7 - Privacy And Account-Deletion Entry Points

- The Privacy Policy entry was discoverable in the app and the document loaded successfully.
- With the app language set to German, the policy was displayed in English; this new localization defect is tracked by [issue #1218](https://github.com/muhammedgaygisiz/travellers-apps/issues/1218). Fixed: the policy is published in all eleven app languages, and any language without policy copy gets the English document with a notice in its own language saying so (see [[issue-1218]]). Recheck the German policy on a physical device in the next pass.
- The Delete Account entry was discoverable.
- Its warning and consequences were understandable, and the flow could be cancelled safely before destructive confirmation.
- Result: pass for the non-destructive entry-point portion of issue #1182. End-to-end deletion with a disposable account remains unverified.

## Session 8 - Fresh Email/Password Registration

- The progress feedback from issue #1185 worked as intended: progress appeared immediately, the submit button was locked, the blocking loading state was understandable, and the initial tap was unambiguous.
- Registration did not complete and onboarding did not open.
- The UI remained indefinitely in the loading state without actionable failure feedback.
- No corresponding new user appeared in production Firebase Auth when the tester checked.
- After a force quit and relaunch, the app returned to an interactive unauthenticated Start screen; no session was restored and the user was still absent from Firebase Auth.
- A controlled second attempt with the same credentials reproduced the failure: after 60 seconds the app was still loading, showed no error, had created no Firebase Auth user, and remained blocked.
- Registration-dependent onboarding, verification-resend, and disposable-account deletion checks are paused until this blocker is fixed.
- Result: fail. New release-candidate blocker [issue #1219](https://github.com/muhammedgaygisiz/travellers-apps/issues/1219) tracks the non-terminating registration attempt.

## Build 89 iOS Session Outcome

- The tester stopped the run after the registration blocker reproduced twice. Registration is a pass criterion, so continuing could not produce valid release-candidate evidence for build 89.
- Passed before abort: build identity and cold start, language switching in normal Settings, currency selection in normal Settings, profile visibility, current-device push enable/disable persistence, and the non-destructive privacy/account-deletion entry points.
- Partial or failed before abort: location-denial recovery remains inconsistent under issue #1183; notification Settings has the misleading disabled Save action in issue #1217; the German app opened an English Privacy Policy in issue #1218, now localized in every app language and awaiting a device recheck; registration is blocked by issue #1219.
- Not executed because of the abort: onboarding-specific language and currency checks, verification resend, disposable-account deletion, photo upload failure and retry, ranking notification delivery, remaining critical native journeys, App Check refusal, Crashlytics, Analytics, dashboard, business app, Android, and web.
- Build 89 is not release-candidate evidence. Resume with a newer named store build after issue #1219 is fixed, starting again with fresh registration before the deferred checks.
