# Test Run 01 - iOS Build 87

## Purpose

Execution record for the release candidate test pass. Originally section
"Preliminary iOS Execution - Build 87" of [[Current State - Release Candidate Test
Charter]], which owns the checks, the device matrix, and the pass criteria this run
was measured against.

The original charter section called this a preliminary execution and carried no run number. "Run 01" is assigned by this page for ordering only; no source names it that.

## Summary

- Date: 28 July 2026
- Platform: iOS
- Build: TestFlight 1.0.1 (87)
- Device: iPhone 12 mini, iOS 26.5.2

Preliminary partial pass; not release-candidate evidence because build 88 was not distributed

Defects filed: Issues [#1182](https://github.com/muhammedgaygisiz/travellers-apps/issues/1182) to [#1190](https://github.com/muhammedgaygisiz/travellers-apps/issues/1190)

## Scope And Outcome

The 28 July 2026 session exercised the store-installed TestFlight build 87 on a physical iPhone 12 mini running iOS 26.5.2 against the production backend. It established a useful baseline but cannot satisfy issue 1176 because build 87 does not contain the failed-photo state and retry workflow required by the charter. Build 88 was present in the native wrapper version files but had not yet been uploaded to TestFlight or Google Play Open Testing.

## Passed Checks

- Cold start restored the existing session and reached the Home feed without an App Check gate or startup error.
- A Bite was created with a gallery photo. The photo uploaded successfully, remained visible after reopening, and the selected restaurant, price, and EUR currency were correct.
- Map position, marker selection, Bite drawer, pan/zoom stability, and Bite navigation worked without an unexpected camera jump.
- Bite, restaurant, and city search each returned and opened the expected result.
- A Bite could be added to a Bucket List, swiped to tried, undone, and reopened with the final state preserved.
- The local gallery opened, contained the newly created Bite photo, and displayed it correctly.
- A restaurant opened from a Bite, its menu and a menu item rendered, and back navigation returned to the Bite.
- A shared `https://bite-tribe.web.app/bite/...` link opened the correct Bite in the native app.
- Background/foreground restoration, force-quit restart, logout/login, Home feed reload, and restoration of the user's existing data worked.
- Email/password registration succeeded and entered the blocking onboarding assistant.
- Identity and profile photo, public visibility, currency override, favorite currency, language, location, notifications, and completion steps all persisted.
- The verification email link worked, verified the account, and removed the in-app verification prompt without an app restart.
- With iOS location permission set to Never, Bite creation remained usable: a restaurant could be selected manually and EUR was inferred from the selected restaurant.
- A previous visit in Jordan could be selected through Google Places, an older photo could be chosen, and JOD was inferred from the restaurant location. The Bite was intentionally not saved, so the final posting-later write remains unverified.
- The public `/privacy` and `/account-deletion` routes loaded in Safari.

## Filed Findings To Triage

1. **[#1182](https://github.com/muhammedgaygisiz/travellers-apps/issues/1182): Account deletion is not available end to end.** The native app exposes no visible Privacy Policy or Account Deletion entry. The public account-deletion page only instructs the user to send an email and does not delete the account. This is a release-candidate blocker candidate because the charter identifies account deletion as a store-review requirement. Implemented: Privacy Policy is reachable from the About page, Delete Account from a destructive section on the Settings page, and the `deleteOwnAccount` callable performs the deletion with an explicit contract per data category (see [[issue-1182]]). Still open: the callable is not deployed, and the physical iOS and Android pass with disposable accounts has not been run.
2. **[#1183](https://github.com/muhammedgaygisiz/travellers-apps/issues/1183): Location denial recovery is unclear.** After changing iOS location access to Never, the app did not explain the denial or open the iOS app-settings page. Manual recovery in iOS Settings worked and the position appeared afterward. Build 89 proved the explanation and the Settings handoff, and left three defects open; all three are now fixed. The refused read carries the OS permission state, so the error card says a denial is only reversible in the settings page and labels its action as that handoff. A successful re-read clears the error even below the 100 m reload threshold, which is where a user who just restored access lands. Returning to the foreground with a location error re-reads the position immediately instead of waiting out the 30-second inactivity threshold. The map's My Position button, the original reproduction path, now settles the permission and explains a denial in an alert with the same Settings action. Re-run the deny-then-enable path on a physical iOS device in the next pass.
3. **[#1184](https://github.com/muhammedgaygisiz/travellers-apps/issues/1184): Push notification settings cannot be changed.** iOS notifications and the stored app preference were on, but the Push Notifications toggle on the app Settings page was disabled. It is now implemented: the account-wide preference is retired in favour of per-installation token controls, a persistent installation identity, an explicit current-device setup action, and an OS-permission recovery route. Physical iOS/Android verification remains open.
4. **[#1185](https://github.com/muhammedgaygisiz/travellers-apps/issues/1185): Registration transition can look unresponsive.** Registration succeeded, but the transition into onboarding took long enough without visible feedback that the tester could not tell whether the tap had worked. Fixed: registration now runs the header progress bar, locks the submit button behind a pending label, and holds a blocking overlay until onboarding is on screen. Re-verify on a physical device in the next pass.
5. **[#1186](https://github.com/muhammedgaygisiz/travellers-apps/issues/1186): Immediate language switching exposes a translation key.** English was initially selected. After choosing German, the UI did not change immediately and the transition briefly displayed `onboarding-advancing` rather than readable copy. The next Location step rendered in German. Fixed: the consumer app re-renders translated text on a language change, the assistant loads the selected locale before activating it, and leaving a step waits for an in-flight language switch before it translates the loading overlay. Re-verify on a physical device in the next pass.
6. **[#1187](https://github.com/muhammedgaygisiz/travellers-apps/issues/1187): Favorite-currency selection is not self-explanatory.** Adding EUR required tapping a heart icon whose action was not initially understood. Fixed: the shared currency selector now has two explicit modes. The preferred-currency mode picks one currency by tapping the row and only marks existing favorites with a localized note; the favorites mode says in words that a tap adds or removes a currency, toggles on the row itself, shows a checkbox plus a highlighted row for the selected state, and names each row with the action and its current state. Onboarding and Settings use the same two modes. Re-verify the currency step with a fresh user on a physical device in the build-88 pass.
7. **[#1188](https://github.com/muhammedgaygisiz/travellers-apps/issues/1188): Profile visibility is not visible on the normal profile page.** The saved public state could only be confirmed by entering profile edit. Fixed: the signed-in user's own personal profile now carries a localized public/private status with its own icon, and activating it opens the existing visibility switch in profile edit. Verify both visibility states on a physical device in the build-88 pass.
8. **[#1189](https://github.com/muhammedgaygisiz/travellers-apps/issues/1189): Verification resend lacks visible confirmation.** The resend action showed no clear in-app success message. Two messages were present afterward, consistent with the initial registration email plus the manual resend, and the newer link worked. Fixed: the resend button on home, settings, and profile edit shows a spinner with a sending label, is disabled while the callable is in flight, and the service ignores a second tap; success, one-hour throttling, already-verified, unsupported-provider, and generic failures each raise their own localized toast, and the button returns to its idle state on every outcome. Re-verify delivery with a disposable account on a physical device in the build-88 pass.
9. **[#1190](https://github.com/muhammedgaygisiz/travellers-apps/issues/1190): The profile deep-link check was a charter defect, not a product gap.** Bite sharing and native opening worked. No profile-sharing link or native profile handler was found because none was ever intended: sharing is a Bite capability, and a profile is an in-app destination reached from a Bite, a follower list, or search. The charter check has been corrected to name Bite details only, and this finding is closed as a specification correction rather than carried as implementation work. See [[issue-1190]].

## Not Executed Or Not Proven On Build 87

- Failed image-upload state and retry with the retained local copy: build 87 does not contain the implementation.
- Retry through the local-image picker when the original local copy is unavailable.
- Ranking-change notification delivery.
- A fresh iOS photo-permission prompt; photo access had already been granted and gallery selection worked.
- A fresh iOS notification-permission prompt; the OS grant already existed.
- Crashlytics non-fatal delivery, Analytics DebugView events, and the key metrics dashboard.
- App Check enforced-mode refusal and retry gate. A normal production session started, but that does not prove the build carried `NX_APP_BITE_TRIBE_APP_CHECK_ENFORCED=true`.
- Final save for the vacation/posting-later scenario.
- Business app manual coverage.
- Android and web execution.

## Build 88 Resume Checklist

After build 88 or newer is available in both stores:

1. Record the exact version, build number, commit SHA, TestFlight upload, and Google Play release.
2. Because [issue #1181](https://github.com/muhammedgaygisiz/travellers-apps/issues/1181) is still open, record the workstation toolchain and manual signing/upload route used for build 88.
3. Repeat the iOS startup/login smoke and create a Bite with a successful photo upload.
4. Force the photo upload offline, verify the failed state, restore connectivity, and verify retry with the retained local copy.
5. Exercise the fallback retry path where the original local copy is unavailable and the app asks for an image from the local gallery.
6. Recheck Bucket List swipe/undo, map position and camera stability, search, local gallery, restaurant menu, and Bite deep link because they are release-critical native journeys.
7. Reproduce and triage or resolve each filed finding above; do not silently carry build-87 findings forward as passes.
8. Complete notification delivery, Crashlytics, DebugView, dashboard, enforced App Check, posting-later save, Business app, Android, and web checks.
