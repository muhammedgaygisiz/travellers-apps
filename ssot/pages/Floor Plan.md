# Floor Plan

## Purpose

A Floor Plan is a restaurant's structured two-dimensional representation of its dining area.

It is the structural connection between a restaurant's physical space and its digital BiteTribe presence. Rooms, tables, and objects become addressable data instead of a drawing.

## Why It Exists

The Floor Plan exists to answer:

> Which physical places in this restaurant can a guest sit at, and how do I address one of them digitally?

Without it, a table QR code, a live occupancy view, and an order attached to table 12 have nothing to refer to.

The Floor Plan is deliberately not an architecturally exact construction plan. It is a practical, easy-to-maintain top-down representation that staff and guests can recognise.

## Business Rules

- A Restaurant can have one Floor Plan.
- A Floor Plan contains one or more Rooms, which may represent rooms, floors, or outdoor areas.
- A Room has physical dimensions and contains geometry objects and Tables.
- Geometry objects are walls, doors, counters, bar areas, blocked areas, chairs, and decorative objects. They carry no business identity.
- A Table is a business entity, not a shape. See [[Table]].
- Chairs are geometry. Seating capacity is a number on the Table.
- A Room cannot be deleted while it still contains Tables.
- A Floor Plan has a draft state and a published state. Only the published state is read by staff and guest surfaces.
- Editing the Floor Plan never writes live table state, and a live state change never writes the Floor Plan.
- Only the owner of the Restaurant may edit the Floor Plan.

## Coordinate System

Coordinates are stored as room-relative integer millimetres.

| Property | Rule                                         |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Origin   | Top-left corner of the room                  |
| x        | Increases to the right                       |
| y        | Increases downward                           |
| Unit     | Millimetres, integer                         |
| Rotation | Degrees clockwise, 0 to 359                  |
| Position | Centre of the shape's unrotated bounding box |

Physical units rather than pixels or normalised values, because real dimensions let the plan be checked for plausibility, printed to scale, and reasoned about for capacity. Integers avoid floating-point drift when snapping. Rendering uses an SVG `viewBox` in millimetres, so desktop, tablet, and mobile scale from identical stored data.

A position is the centre and not a corner, for geometry objects exactly as for tables, so that `rotation` means one thing everywhere: the shape turns about its own position, and a rotated object keeps the anchor the editor dragged. Issue \#1080 made that explicit when the model was written; the earlier wording named only the table and left an object's anchor undecided.

## Required Data

Room:

| Field     | Description                                          |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`      | Unique room identifier                               |
| `name`    | Display name, such as main dining room or terrace    |
| `order`   | Ascending display order among the restaurant's rooms |
| `size`    | `{ width, height }` in millimetres                   |
| `objects` | Geometry objects in the room                         |
| `version` | Optimistic concurrency version                       |

Floor plan object:

| Field      | Description                                                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `id`       | Unique object identifier                                           |
| `type`     | `wall`, `door`, `counter`, `bar`, `blocked`, `decoration`, `chair` |
| `position` | `{ x, y }` in room millimetres, centre of the object               |
| `size`     | `{ width, height }` in millimetres                                 |
| `rotation` | Degrees clockwise                                                  |
| `label`    | Optional display label                                             |

## Optional Data

- Floor or level grouping across rooms
- Grid spacing preference
- Per-room capacity summary

## Relationships

```text
Restaurant
|-- Floor Plan
    |-- Rooms
        |-- Floor plan objects (geometry)
        |-- Tables (business entities)
```

## Lifecycle

```text
Restaurant is owned by a user with the business role
|
Owner creates a room and sets its dimensions
|
Owner places geometry and tables
|
Owner assigns table numbers and capacities
|
Owner validates and publishes the plan
|
QR tokens are generated for enabled tables
|
Published plan is read by staff live view and by guest QR resolution
```

## Permissions

- Guest: no access to the plan structure. A guest only ever resolves a single table through a QR token.
- Registered user: no access.
- Restaurant staff: read the published plan. No write access.
- Restaurant owner: full read and write.
- Admin: full access for support and moderation.

## Use Cases

- [[UC - Configure Restaurant Floor Plans And Tables]]
- [[UC - Order At The Table Through A QR Code]]

- Issue \#1069 - Restaurant ownership, claiming and authorization (prerequisite)

## Technical Implementation

Planned Firestore layout:

```text
/restaurants/{restaurantId}/rooms/{roomId}
/restaurants/{restaurantId}/tables/{tableId}
```

Non-table geometry lives as an array inside its room document because it is always loaded and saved together. Tables are separate documents because they are business entities with independent lifecycles, referenced by live state, visits, and orders.

Libraries, of which only the shared model exists today:

```text
libs/bite-tribe-common/model            floor plan, room, table types
libs/bite-tribe-business/floor-plan/page
libs/bite-tribe-business/floor-plan/ui
libs/bite-tribe-business/floor-plan/data-access
```

Issue \#1080 wrote the model as two files in `libs/bite-tribe-common/model/src/lib`: `floor-plan.ts` holds `Room`, `FloorPlanObject`, and the coordinate-system primitives `Millimetres`, `FloorPlanPoint`, `FloorPlanSize`, and `FloorPlanRotation`; `restaurant-table.ts` holds `RestaurantTable`. The coordinate system above is repeated as the file header of `floor-plan.ts`, because the rule has to be readable where the fields are.

`RestaurantTable` is a union discriminated on `shape`, so a `round` table carries a `diameter` and a `rectangle` carries a `size` and neither can carry both. That library is types only, so nothing in it can drift into a helper the persistence layer should own.

Rendering uses SVG rather than canvas: object counts are low, hit-testing and accessibility come for free, and it prints cleanly for QR sheets.

## Current Limitations

- No behaviour is shipped. Issue \#1080 landed the shared types and this page's coordinate system; there is no persistence, no editor, and no QR token yet.
- Depends on restaurant ownership and authorization. `apps/bite-tribe-firebase/firestore.rules` is ownership-scoped since issue \#1078, but it is deployed by hand, so restaurant-scoped data is only trustworthy in production once `npx nx firebase-deploy-rules bite-tribe-firebase` has run. The rules also say nothing about rooms or tables yet; issue \#1081 owns that.
- Multi-floor grouping is modelled but may ship after single-room support.
- No CAD import, no exact scale drawing, and no automatic layout.

## Future Ideas

- Capacity planning and turnover analysis derived from the plan
- Guest-facing room preview when choosing a table
- Reservation blocks drawn directly on the plan
